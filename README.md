# **Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development (HTML5 / CSS3)**

*Note: crossed off sections are yet to be completed in the project.*

~~Desribe the brief here~~


## **UX**

I designed the website as a platform for the artist's fans to become familiar with the latest updates on Gashi and also get some extra content like videos and a gallery, along with access to his social media. The target audience for this particular project is young (mainly people in their twenties and early thirties) therefore they are more likely to use the application on their mobile phones rather than computers. The age of users was also a factor in including more images and videos instead of focusing on text (hence the lack of "About" section which would have been a lot of text).

The website is built with four separate pages:
* Home
* Gallery
* Tour 
* Contact

As mentioned before, originally the page was supposed to contain “About” section but after researching a range of other musician website in similar music field, I came to the conclusion that it is not important or desirable. 

Most of the musician-related websites that I visited, were colourful and had a lot of content, therefore for Gashi's website I chose to use mainly shades of gray with very little colour to make it stand out. It also goes with his general image - his album covers are very simple and easy on the eye. 

I have included wireframes for my project, however after making the decision to go with the gray scale option, I decided to change the design of the website since the original idea was more fitted with a wider colour range.
